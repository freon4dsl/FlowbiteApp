# Freon Flowbite App

A second web application for Freon, developed using Flowbite (https://flowbite-svelte.com/) and Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com/.

This repository contains the source code for the example of the Freon documentation 
site (https://www.freon4dsl.dev/). It is divided into a number of branches, each 
corresponding with one of the lessons. The main branch contains the completed result.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
